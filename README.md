This program solves a quadratic equation.
It includes an explanation regarding this type of equation so as to help the user understand its purpose, after which it asks for the values of the coefficients in order to accomplish its objective.
The use of Thread.sleep() to create a delay between the output of each statement is not necessary, but it can make the program more interactive and easy to read.
